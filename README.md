##Project Aim: Social Media Analysis Report
Objective:
The goal of this project is to analyze social media data and provide actionable insights. Weâ€™ll explore various aspects of social media activity, including hourly trends, engagement metrics, country-specific patterns, and popular hashtags. By visualizing the data, we aim to uncover meaningful patterns and correlations.

Categorized Tasks:
Hourly Social Media Activity:
Objective: Understand how social media activity varies throughout the day.
Visualization: Create a line chart or bar chart showing posts, retweets, and likes per hour.
Distributions of Retweets and Likes:
Objective: Examine the distribution of engagement levels (retweets and likes).
Visualization: Use histograms or density plots.
Country Activity:
Objective: Identify countries with the highest and lowest social media activity.
Visualization: Display a map highlighting activity levels across different countries.
Top Hashtags:
Objective: Discover frequently used hashtags.
Visualization: Generate a bar chart or word cloud sorted by frequency.
Correlation between Retweets and Likes:
Objective: Explore the relationship between retweets and likes.
Visualization: Create a scatter plot with retweets on the X-axis and likes on the Y-axis.
Outliers in Retweets and Likes:
Objective: Detect exceptional posts (viral content or anomalies).
Visualization: Utilize box plots or scatter plots.
Variation Over Time (Hourly, Daily, Monthly):
Objective: Observe trends across different time intervals.
Visualization: Construct line charts or area charts for hourly, daily, and monthly patterns.
Comparison Across Platforms:
Objective: Compare social media activity across platforms (e.g., Twitter, Instagram).
Visualization: Use stacked bar charts or grouped bar charts.
